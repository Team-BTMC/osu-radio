The left sidebar has tabs for Songs and Settings, a search bar with filters, and a list of four song cards with title, artist, and length. The right side has player controls, with a square song cover image, song title, and artist. Below, icons for volume, shuffle, previous, play/pause, next, repeat, and add to playlist. In the top-right there is a queue icon.")

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Team-BTMC/osu-radio.git

```sh
cd osu-radio
```

`2` | Next, install the necessary dependencies to run osu!radio,

```sh

## The Vision

Technologies:

- Electron
- SolidJS
- TypeScript

Discussion mainly happens in the [BTMC TALENT SERVER](https://discord.gg/VvMzQ3AxFT), in the `#prj-osu-radio` channel.
<br />
We're not interested in changing tech stacks for this project for the time being. We're sticking with Electron and web tech for now.
